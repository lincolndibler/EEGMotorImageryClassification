# EEGEmotionRecognitionClassification

# 🧠 EEG-Based Emotion Recognition

This project focuses on recognizing human emotions using EEG (electroencephalography) signals. By analyzing brainwave patterns, we aim to classify emotional states such as happiness, sadness, calmness, and excitement using deep learning models.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Preprocess EEG signals for emotion classification
- Extract meaningful features from EEG data (e.g., frequency bands, entropy)
- Train deep learning models to classify emotional states
- Evaluate model performance using standard metrics (accuracy, F1-score, etc.)
