# EEGMotorImageryClassification

# 🧠 EEG Motor Imagery Classification (BCI Competition IV-2a)

This project explores the use of deep learning to classify motor imagery tasks from EEG signals. Using data from the BCI Competition IV-2a dataset, we aim to decode imagined movements (left hand, right hand, feet, tongue) and contribute to the development of non-invasive brain-computer interfaces.

## 🚀 Goals
- Preprocess and visualize EEG signals
- Train a CNN to classify motor imagery tasks
- Evaluate model performance across subjects
- Explore interpretability and real-world BCI applications
